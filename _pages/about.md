I'm currently leading a small research group at the Senckenberg Society for Nature Research. I have two main research focuses; examining how the metagenomes of triatomines change when exposed to trypanosomes, and identifying new natural products from microbiomes that may have medicinal properties. 

I have a PhD in Molecular Biology and have spent my academic career handling large datasets (genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic) to gain useful ecological insights. I'm happy to discuss academic collaborations and am also open to opportunities in industry. Get in touch if you think I can help with your project!
